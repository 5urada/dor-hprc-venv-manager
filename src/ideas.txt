TODO: add logging


Thoughts:

make sure we're handling missing keys in the metadata file

need to check for user trying to create environment with the same name. 

add loading bar for cli users

user disconnnects from cluster during creation, deletes env themselves

would $SCRATCH/virtual_envs maybe not exist?

possible permissions issues when creating/deleting environments
